📝 Summary:
  Two machine learning solutions are devised: a multivariate, multi-class, time-series classification model; and a long short- term memory (LSTM) forecasting regression model. 
Both solutions use a novel metric of playlist success, the number of ‘conversions’ a playlist elicits in the form of saved songs, whilst incorporating recurrent neural networks, a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 
Accuracy of 92% is achieved through an ensemble classification model. Genre-specific illustrations are developed for the forecasting model and four emerging genre-unspecific trends are identified. 
Estimation of a playlists’ conversions for further modelling, planning, and detailed, synergetic insights are acquired for marketing teams to enhance their playlist pitching efforts.
